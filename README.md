# ðŸ“š Graph Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my Python implementations of 11 core graph algorithms, each placed in its own directory with modular structure and independent dependencies.

- Strongly connected components

BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Visitation order<br>

- Topological order for edge relaxation<br>
- Distance & parent arrays<br>
- Supports single-source shortest paths


## ðŸ§  Design Principles

ðŸ§ª Validation: Every algorithm checks for graph validity (e.g. directedness, connectivity, negative weights, source/sink validity).

ðŸ§© Modularity: Each algorithm is in its own folder with separate main.py, helpers, and .gitignore.

âš™ Dependencies: Shared logic (e.g. DFS for SCC or Kruskal) is imported properly. Virtual environments are used in some folders, but excluded from Git.

ðŸ§µ Clean Output: Each main file prints relevant data structures (like parent and distance arrays, MST edges and cost, flow/residual graphs) in a readable format.


## ðŸ“Œ Notes

The Fibonacci heap is implemented manually and optimized for Dijkstra and Prim.

In Johnsonâ€™s algorithm, Dijkstra with Fibonacci heap is reused for better asymptotic efficiency.

Some algorithms (like Kruskal, Johnson) rely on helper algorithms (like DFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra).

All code is written in Python 3, and tested on various graph configurations.


## ðŸ§ª How to Run

Navigate to each algorithm folder and if main.py exists run:

python main.py

otherwise run the relevant algorithm.py for each algorithm.
